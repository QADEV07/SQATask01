What is Agile Software?
Agile software development methodology is an process for developing software 
(like other software development methodologies – Waterfall model, V-Model, Iterative model etc.) 
However, Agile methodology differs significantly from other methodologies. In English, 
Agile means ‘ability to move quickly and easily’ and responding swiftly to change – this 
is a key aspect of Agile software development as well.
